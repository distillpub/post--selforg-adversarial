Building on this, we discuss the implications of cascading behavior in a number of online settings, including word-of-mouth effects (also known as “viral marketing”) in the success of new products, and the influence of social networks in the growth of online communities.IntroductionThe process by which new ideas and new behaviors spread through a population has long been a fundamental question in the social sciences. New religious beliefs or political movements; shifts in society that lead to greater tolerance or greater polarization; the adoption of new technological, medical, or agricultural innovations; the sudden success of a new product; the rise to prominence of a celebrity or political candidate; the emergence of bubbles in financial markets and their subsequent implosion – these phenomena all share some important qualitative properties.}, booktitle={Algorithmic Game Theory}, publisher={Cambridge University Press}, author={Kleinberg, Jon}, year={2007}, month={Sep}, pages={613–632} }

Our goal is to find a small set S of nodes such that targeting the product to S would lead to adoption of the product by a large number of nodes in the graph. We show strong inapproximability results for several variants of this problem. Our main result says that the problem of minimizing the size of S, while ensuring that targeting S would influence the whole network into adopting the product, is hard to approximate within a polylogarithmic factor. This implies a similar result if only a fixed fraction of the network is ensured to adopt the product. Further, the hardness of approximation result continues to hold when all nodes have majority thresholds or have constant degrees and thresholds two. The latter answers a complexity question proposed in [P. A. Dreyer, Applications and Variations of Domination in Graphs, Ph.D. thesis, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ, 2000], [F. S. Roberts, Graph-theoretical problems arising from defending against bioterrorism and controlling the spread of fires, in Proceedings of DIMACS/DIMATIA/Renyi Combinatorial Challenges Conference, Piscataway, NJ, 2006].

Conversely, pairwise interactions are often not enough to characterize social contagion processes such as opinion formation or the adoption of novelties, where complex mechanisms of influence and reinforcement are at work. Here we introduce a higher-order model of social contagion in which a social system is represented by a simplicial complex and contagion can occur through interactions in groups of different sizes. Numerical simulations of the model on both empirical and synthetic simplicial complexes highlight the emergence of novel phenomena such as a discontinuous transition induced by higher-order interactions. We show analytically that the transition is discontinuous and that a bistable region appears where healthy and endemic states co-exist. Our results help explain why critical masses are required to initiate social changes and contribute to the understanding of higher-order interactions in complex systems.}, number={1}, journal={Nature communications}, author={Iacopini, Iacopo and Petri, Giovanni and Barrat, Alain and Latora, Vito}, year={2019}, month={Jun}, pages={2485} }

This problem is known as Target Set Selection in a social network (TSS Problem) and more popularly, Social Influence Maximization Problem (SIM Problem). This is an active area of research in computational social network analysis domain since one and half decades or so. Due to its practical importance in various domains, such as viral marketing, target advertisement, personalized recommendation, the problem has been studied in different variants, and different solution methodologies have been proposed over the years. Hence, there is a need for an organized and comprehensive review on this topic. This paper presents a survey on the progress in and around TSS Problem.
